          Hiya, I’m a junior studying chemical engineering at Cornell University. I've
          been into art since I was a little girl in elementary. Sadly, when it came to
          high school, I abandoned visual art because I only had one elective slot, and
          and so I pursued choir. I fell out of touch with my artistic side until my
          summer job after freshman year, where I taught at a girls coding camp. One
          of the courses I taught was about web design & photography, and hence my love
          for design was renewed.<br><br>

          My senior photographer, Ling Wang, inspired me to explore photography and
          develop my own style. Sometimes I get caught up inclasses and life in general,
          and so over a year ago, I started an extensive photography theme titled “A
          Ceiling Fan” (it’s a pun ha). Basically, I look up and try to capture the
          brilliance of those things that lie above us, either if they’re spectacular
          or not. Many of the photos you see are from Cornell, but there are some from
          around the world, too. I hope pictures of looking up inspire people to
          always think positively and keep moving forward.<br><br>

          About a year ago, I started seriously persuing calligraphy. I've always been
          the one in my class that had the "typewriter" handwriting, so I started thinking
          about making art out of that -- handlettering. I chose quotes that are obscure
          and simple, but reveal a deep truth. People ask me what the trick is to my art,
          but truthfully, it's just persistence to learn. The advantage of such a technological
          society is that there are plenty of resources available to help you learn,
          so it's never too late to start learning.<br><br>
